# Managing_Large_Data


## The Raw Data at a glance.
At a glance. This dataset has 1,584,315 rows and 26 columns. The dataset is also filled with missing values, null/Nan cells, information that is incomplete and consolidated information that should have its own column(s).

## Actionable Information
Once it was determined what information I could and could not use; I went ahead and removed them from the set. Upon review, I realized that  I could add an entirely new cell called "Difference" which is the difference (in days) from the crime occrring and being reported. I also thought it prudent to seperate the geolaction column into two individual columns for latitude and longitude.

Now that the data is manageable. We can create insights.
